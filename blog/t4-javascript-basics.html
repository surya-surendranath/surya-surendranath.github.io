                                                   <p > 
                                                   1.How does javascript compare to html and css?
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p >
                                                   JavaScript as an extension to HTMLor it is an add-on
                                                   HTML is the language in which web pages are written to be interpreted by the server as a graphic interface. Javascipt is similar, but is actually a web-adapted version of actual programming code, intended to write applets (small, web-based applications) for use on websites. They are both a type of code, but html is NOT a programming code. The HTML defines what the webpage looks like, the javascript handles things like counters, games, etc. Other web-based scripting languages, such as php and asp can be used to create entire webpages, but, like Javascript, are generally confined to handling what goes beyond the cosmetics of a website. And if we talk about CSS,it is much simpler and basic when it comes to web page formatting and designing.Â  JavaScript is more advanced, and offers more functions and interactions for a web page.The script tag should be used for JavaScript functions, while CSS directly defines the HTML element. CSS is supported by all browsers, while JavaScript is only supported by major browsers.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p > 
                                                   2.Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for waking up or brushing your teeth?
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p >
                                                    One of the most powerful feature of javascript is the ability to build intelligence and logic into web pages. Looping and control flow is the primary mechanism to perform the same task over and over again until a set of criteria are met. 
                                                    In our day to day life we are performing the same process. We wake up at a particular time. perform the next task ie brushing the teeth, It is set to 5 or 10 minutes. Then drink coffee or tea.If no milk, either skip the coffee and tea or buy milk from shop. Then taking breakfast at a particular time and go to work. If late take bus otherwise walk. Do the work at office. Take another task once you finish the previous one, otherwise do it and finish it as soon as possible. So these are some example case of control flow and loop which we do in our daily life. I think everything in our life is looped.
                                                   </p> 
                                                    <p > 
                                                   3.Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p >
                                                    To access the values on this object, you can use “dot notation”, that is, the name of the object, a dot, and the name of the property: ie  console.log(person.name). But To access the values, you use a numerical index: ie console.log(arr[0])


                                                  </p>
                                                   <p > 
                                                    3.Explain what functions are and why they are useful?
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p >
                                                    A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.
                                                  </p>
