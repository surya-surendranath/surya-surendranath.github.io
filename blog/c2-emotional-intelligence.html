        1.What learning did you take from the chapter?
    </p>
     <p>
        Emotional intelligence impacts many different aspects of our daily life, such as the way we behave and the way you interact with others. The important outcome of EI is reducing stress, remaining focused, and staying connected to yourself and others.It can help us to navigate the social complexities of the workplace, lead and motivate others, and excel in your career.On the other hand it can be acquired and improved with practice.

       2.How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
    </p>
    <p >
        The mindfulness is all about our mind. I found that it can be gradually developed using meditational practices. The major part of our failure and success come from our mind. Mind is the one direct us to do all things. Being clear mind is important for implementing succesful things. So meditation help us to concentrate and help to be in a default mindset, that is happiness.Apart from that meditation alleviate a variety of mental and physical conditions, such as bringing about reductions in depression symptoms, reducing stress,anxiety,and in the treatment of drug addiction.
