                                                        <h1 id="header1"> MINDFULNESS<br> </h1>
                                                        <p> 
                                                        1.What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
                                                       </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         Mindfulness is often seen as a synonym for awareness, I believe mindfulness is more of a subset.Practicing mindfulness is practicing a type of awareness that is thoroughly accepting, highly self inspecting, and intensely focused on qualification and quantification of the subject of that awareness. It's almost like awareness squared. Awareness is a little more vague of a term. It can be used in the sense of non-dual awareness, where the distinction between observer and observed fades away, or choiceless awareness, the state of mind where you drop all intention and aren't drawn towards or away from any object.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p> 
                                                          2.Try atleast one of the self awareness practices from the chapter(Body,Scan,journaling).What was your experience to it.How did you feel?
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         I tried self analysis. I feel like we should write down and analyze our strengths and weaknesses so that we become aware of them. Our weaknesses is what we are working on and your strengths help you to convert weaknesses. By practicing self analysis you become aware of your strength and weaknesses, bad habits,opportunities seized or missed etc.
                                                       </p>
                                                        <p> 
                                                         3.What did you take away from the "My Emotions are not me"section?
                                                         <P>
                                                        Yes, definitely my emotions are not me.It's just a temporary comfortnance from my thoughts. Once we realize that we are the ones choosing, we can no longer blame our circumstances for making us think or feeling a certain way. Once we see that our perceptions and the meaning we give to life's circumstances shape our experience it is up to us to be selective about which thoughts and emotions we are going to believe and buy into even midst challenges.
                                                        </p>

                                                        </p>
