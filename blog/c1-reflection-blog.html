     <h1 > REFLECTION<br> </h1>
     <p> 
           1.What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
     </p>
     <p>
          I find everyone at EDA is very helpful and collaborative.I felt the assignments are bit challenging for me, but i am focussing on learning new stuffs. 
     </p>
     <p> 
          2.What are your impression?
     </p>
      <p>
          My idea is to learn gradually, do the works as much I can, think clearly and positively and aim for a better.
     </p>
     <p> 
          3.How do you see yourself engaging with this culture?
     </p>
     <p>
          I like everyone to work together and help each other. If I know any answers definitely I will help you. Also, I will never hesitate to work with anyone in ourteam.
     </p>
     <p>
          Have your expectations at EDA changed? If so, how?
     </p>
    <p >
          Yes, beacause initially I thought the learning style is quite similar to Uni like attending regular classes, lectures, homeworks. But it is totally different here.The focus is fully on gaining practical learning experience rather than traditional aural way of learning, that excited me lot.
    </p>
     <p > 
          5.Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?Does it make you nervous?
    </p>
     <p >
          Yes. I am so excited to learn at EDA. The programming is challenging for me. Yes, that makes me nervous. But I think we should take challenge in our life because it makes life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.
