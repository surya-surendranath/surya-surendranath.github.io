   <p > <br><b>1.&nbsp;What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?<b/></p>
    <p ><b>
     I find everyone at EDA is very helpful and collaborative.I felt the assignments are bit challenging for me, but i am focussing on learning new stuffs. </b>
   </p>
    <p > <b>2.&nbsp;What are your impression?</b></p>
    <p >
     <b>My idea is to learn gradually, do the works as much I can, think clearly and positively and aim for a better.</b>
   </p>
   
    <p > <b>3.&nbsp;How do you see yourself engaging with this culture?</b></p>
    <p >
    <b>I like everyone to work together and help each other. If I know any answers definitely I will help you. Also, I will never hesitate to work with anyone in our<br></b> team.
   </p>
    <p ><b> 4.&nbsp;Have your expectations at EDA changed? If so, how?</b></p>
    <p >
    <b>Yes, beacause initially I thought the learning style is quite similar to Uni like attending regular classes, lectures, homeworks. But it is totally different here.<br>The focus is fully on gaining practical learning experience rather than traditional aural way of learning, that excited me lot.</b>
   </p>
    <p > <b>&nbsp;Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?Does it make you nervous</b></p>
    <p >
    <b> Yes. I am so excited to learn at EDA. The programming is challenging for me. Yes, that makes me nervous. But I think we should take challenge in our life <br>because it makes life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.</b>
