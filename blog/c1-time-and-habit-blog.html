     <h1> TIME AND HABIT </h1>
     <p> 
        1.Which time and habit technique did you try?
     </p>
     <p >
        I have tried the technique of "making it big by starting small". I will be trying "pomodoro technique" and fogg method for my
     future assignments.
     </p>
     <p>
        2.What did you find interesting?
     </p>
     <p>
        Since time is very crucial for doing all assignments works, I am trying to make some changes in my habits. By trying the habit techniques,I felt I can easily complete the assignments on time. Apart from that, I will create some timeboxes so that I can get some extra time to review and analyse myself how much I have learned.
     </p>
     <p>
        3.What worked for you?</p>
     <p>
       The above techniques helped me to complete the assignments on time, that made me confident to do this course further with full potential.
     </p>
     <p>
       4.Which will you experiment furthur with?
     </p>
     <p>
        I will experiment the pomodoro techniques with 25 minute time boxes daily. I will make minimun 5 hours everyday to spend on assignments with this technique, which hopefully help me to complete the assignments before the deadlines.
