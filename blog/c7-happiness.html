                                                        <p> 
                                                        1.How does life look throgh the 'pleasure,passion and purpose' lens?
                                                       </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         These three elements contribute happiness and success in our life. My life is all filled with passion and purpose which made the way till here. I was a purposeful person in my childhood and a passionate person when I grown up. From my childhood itself I started seeking my purpose of life,what I want to become, what I can do once I grown up. Puposefully I took computer science in twelth. Further all my studies and job was based on Information technology which gave me so much pleasure in my life. I felt like I found my real purpose and happiness. I believe Happiness is all about satisfying these three components.

                                                        <p> 
                                                          2.What are your core values on discovering values and higher purpose exercize?
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                        Self confidence is the primary key to get success in our life. If we eradicate all our fears, we will succeed and we can move forward with great passion and purpose with all around happiness. This is I discovered from my life.

                                                        <p> 
                                                          2.What do you stand for?
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         Courage to do whatever we want, hardwork and a strong positive attitude in every single work.
                                                       </p>
                                                        <p> 
                                                          2.How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercize?
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                          This is what I have already mentioned about self confidence and courage. I think everone has to gone through some kind of failures and disappontment in their life. My opinion is that we need to accept it, face it and later we can use it as a tool for solving similar issues in our life. Meditation help mostly for avoiding unnecessary thoughts and fill our mind with positive enrgy. I think these all help us to increase our confidence to achieve what our purpose is.

                                                          2.Any other musings?
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         Try to smile everyday. Happiness is also a day today package of love, kindness and effort.
